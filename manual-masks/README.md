These are the older reference volumes that are too large to maintain on GitHub. The VS02 server maintains the original files and scripts from which they were created. You can also find them here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/k3nr63t5blcp0om/AACaJvAsNZ8OJX62aFj4FkzKa?dl=0

NB! These files are no longer used, since we moved to a NMTv2 and AFNI's blip-up/down undistortion strategy.
