In order to add data downloaded from SCNAT, create a file that copies data
from the Data_raw directory to this directory, create a file like this:
Data_raw/EDDY/20170511/copy-to-proc.sh

I've started playing around with organizing the raw data according to the
BIDS definition:

http://bids.neuroimaging.io
