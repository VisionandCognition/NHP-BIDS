In order to add data downloaded from SCNAT, create a file that copies data
from the Data_raw directory to this directory, create a file like this:
Data_raw/EDDY/20170511/copy-to-proc.sh

This pipeline uses NiPype to create the data that tries to adhere to [BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io).

There is documentation in the python scripts and at:
